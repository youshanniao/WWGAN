# WWGAN (Worm Wasserstein GANs)

This is the official Pytprch implementation of WWGAN model presented in [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9760052](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9760052)

> Worm Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network(WWGAN) is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for time-series data augmentation. WWGAN builds upon two [WGAN-GP](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp) by constructing the WGAN-GP into a recurrent structure like RNN to improve its data augmentation ability on time-series data. 

> WWGAN can which generates synthetic time-series data that carry realistic intrinsic patterns with the original data and expands a small sample without prior knowledge or hypotheses. Which means it can augment one-diminational time-series data.
